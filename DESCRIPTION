Title: Genetic Algorithm for Curve Fitting
Author: Telford Tendys <gafit@lnx-bsp.net>

Depends: R (>= 3.0.0)
Description: A group of sample points are evaluated against a
        user-defined expression, the sample points are lists of
        parameters with values that may be substituted into that
        expression. The genetic algorithm attempts to make the result
        of the expression as low as possible (usually this would be the
        sum of residuals squared).
